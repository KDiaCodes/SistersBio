  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h3>
  <p>Lymphatic vessels and ducts as well as lymph organs make up the intricate transportation system of the lymphatic system. These vessels move a fluid named lymph away from the bodies tissues and the capillaries to be filtered by nodes and organs, before being brought back into the bloodstream. The lymphatic organs, which includes the thymus and spleen, diffuses a fluid containing lymphocytes and other defence cells that are made by the bone marrow to aid in protecting the body.

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">The Lymph and it's components</h3>
  <p>The lymph comes from the interstitial fluid that encompasses the cells of the bodies. When the arterial blood arrives at the arterial capillaries, a lot of it moves into the venous capillaries however around 10% of the bloods plasma leaks from the capillaries and makes the interstitial fluid that surrounds the cells. When this fluid goes into the lymphatic capillaries it turns into the lymph. The lymphatic capillaries move the fluid into the bigger lymphatic vessels, which transport the fluid towards the lymph nodes and lymphoid organs. The nodes and organs filter the lymph and eliminate all the harmful materials. The filtered lymph then is transported towards the major lymphatic ducts— the thoracic duct and right lymphatic duct, which can be found at the intersection between the subclavian and internal jugular veins. These ducts empty the filtered lymph into the veins to return to the bloodstream. (Visiblebody.com, 2018) The make-up of the interstitial fluid and the lymph are very alike, the main difference is that the lymph has more lymphocytes than the interstitial fluid. The lymph appears as a transparent, colourless or in some cases a slightly yellow liquid. Lymph is very similar to the blood plasma and is made up of: (Modric, 2018)

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Lymphocytes and macrophages</h3>
  <p>Lymphocytes are one of the most important types of immune cells.  Lymphocytes are usually separated into B and T cells.
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>B lymphocytes create the antibodies – antibodies are proteins that identify foreign materials and joins with the foreign materials.  B lymphocytes are each instructed to make one specific antibody.  When a B lymphocyte finds its antigen, this does so that there is an increase of plasma cells.  This is because each plasma cell is basically a factory making antibodies.  An antibody connects with an antigen a lot like when a key connects with a lock.  When the antibody and antigen join, the antibody marks the antigen for demolition.  B lymphocytes are incapable to pierce the cell so the task of attacking these antigens is given to T lymphocytes. (Chemocare.com, 2018)
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>T lymphocytes are cells that are instructed to identify, respond to and recall antigens.  T lymphocytes add to the immune defences in two big ways. Some of the T lymphocytes guide and control the immune reactions to possible antigens.  When these T lymphocytes are stimulated by the antigenic substances shown by the macrophages, the T lymphocytes create lymphokines that indicates to other cells that there are antigens in the body. The other T lymphocytes are capable to destroy the marked antigens when they come into direct contact. (Chemocare.com, 2018)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Macrophages are the body's first line of defence and have many distinct functions.  A macrophage is the first cell to identify and surround the antigens.  The macrophages break down these foreign substances and shows the antigens to the T lymphocytes that identify, respond and recall antigens.  Macrophages also make materials called cytokines that aid to control the activity of lymphocytes. (Chemocare.com, 2018) The macrophages also move to and move within nearly all of the tissues, in many ways patrolling the tissues for pathogens as well as removing any dead cells they come across.

  <h3 style="text-align:center;">Why tissue fluid is drained</h3>
  <p>As the blood is transported throughout the arteries and veins, 10% of the liquid that is filtered by the capillaries, as well as the important proteins, get stuck in the various tissues of the body. This loss of liquid, which adds up to around 1-2 litres per day, would very quickly become life threatening if the lymphatic system did not work correctly. The lymphatic system gathers this fluid that has become stuck and filters it before returning it to the circulatory system. (Lgdalliance.org, 2018) If this fluid, that has gotten stuck in the tissues, is not removed from the tissues it builds up within the tissue resulting in swelling. After a while it would impair the circulation within that area of the body which condenses the surrounding structures and organs resulting in a variety of conditions. Furthermore, if the proteins are not brought back into the circulatory system by the lymphatic system, the body would not have enough proteins to sustain life and if this is not quickly fixed then it is life threatening. At times if the proteins are not quickly returned to the circulatory system death could occur as soon as within 24 hours. (Healthhype.com, 2018)
